Thanks for downloading MyPy.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.6 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

Or you can just copy the entire "MyPy" directory to Python's site-packages
directory, which is located wherever your Python installation lives.
