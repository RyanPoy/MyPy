MyPy - MySQL Connector in Pure Python
=====================================

Python MySQL Connector aims to be a full replacement for MySQLdb. It is a total rewrite of MySQL server/client protocol in pure Python, which means MySQL libraries written in C are not needed anymore.

As a experiment project, MyPy's objectives are:

  -  Get rid of compiling when use MySQLdb
  -  As fast as connectors written in C
  -  Less than 2,000 lines (except tests)
  -  Compatible with Python 2.6+ and Python 3
