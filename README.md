Python MySQL Connector
======================

Python MySQL Connector aims to be a full replacement for MySQLdb.  It is a rewrite of MySQL server/client protocol in pure Python, which means no MySQL libraries written in C are needed, and thus no compiling.  Python MySQL Connector is a Python DB API v2.0 compliant adapter, and our objective is to compat with Python 3.
